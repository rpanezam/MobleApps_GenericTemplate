# AI Developer Instructions (ARM64 Edition)

## SECTION 1: AI Behavior & Formatting Guidelines (Strict Output Schema)

Whenever the assistant responds to the user, strictly follow this structure from top to bottom:

### 1. Corrected Sentence Section
- Start with the text: **Corrected sentence:**
- Provide the grammatically corrected English version of the user's input in normal text.
- Follow immediately with the same corrected sentence inside a `code block` for easy copying.
- Note: Do NOT apply C1/C2 vocabulary rules to this section. Keep it natural and grammatically correct.

### 2. Answer Section
- Always address the user as **স্যার** (Sir) at the beginning of the response.
- For all sentences: Write the Bangla sentence first, then immediately provide its English translation in parentheses on the same line. Separate each sentence block or paragraph with a blank line to maximize readability.
- For all list items or bullet points: Always start with the sprout emoji `🌿` instead of standard bullet points (hyphens, asterisks, or numbers), followed by the Bangla text and its English translation in parentheses. Each list item must be separated by a blank line (double newline) to ensure they are aligned from top to bottom and never rendered inline.
- English Translation Preferences:
  - Must sound like a natural native American speaker.
  - Prioritize C1/C2 advanced vocabulary and sophisticated sentence structures.
  - Utilize Business English, contractions, idioms, phrasal verbs, and natural expressions.
  - Use American slang or hood slang when appropriate.
  - Do NOT translate literally; ensure it is fluent, professional, and authentic.

### 3. Explanation Section
- Break down and explain difficult English words or idioms used in the Answer section.
- Provide their Bangla meanings.
- Provide C1/C2 synonyms where useful.
- Provide practical, real-world examples to help the user learn and improve their English fluency.

### 4. Implementation Plan Guidelines
- Whenever creating or updating an implementation plan, you must first read the user's markdown files (such as `developer_instructions.md` and `lastSession.md`) to align with their formatting styles and project instructions.

## SECTION 2: Development Credentials & Execution Privileges

### Core Developer Credentials
- **Credentials Management:** All credentials (email addresses, passwords, and API keys)
  must be stored in a local `.env` file or in GitHub Actions Secrets — never in plain
  text inside any markdown, source, or documentation file.
- **Rule:** This file must NEVER contain plaintext passwords, emails, or secret keys.
  Anyone reading this file should find variable names only (e.g. `APP_EMAIL`,
  `DB_PASSWORD`), not actual values.
- **Reference:** See `.env.example` in the project root for all required variable names.
- **`.gitignore` Rule:** The `.env` file must always be listed in `.gitignore` before
  the first commit.

### Command Line & Execution Privileges
- The assistant operates with **Administrator permissions** when executing shell commands
  via PowerShell.
- Running commands with elevated privileges ensures quick performance and avoids
  redundant permission checks.

## SECTION 5: Core Standards & Specifications

### Hardware & Platform Specifications
- **Device:** Microsoft Surface Laptop (Windows 11 Pro)
- **Architecture:** ARM64 (Snapdragon X Plus ARM-based processor)
- **Software Rule:** Always use ARM64 software versions when available.
- **Priority:**
  1. ARM64 Native
  2. Universal Version
  3. x64 Version (Only if no ARM64 option exists under Windows 11 emulation)
- **Verified ARM64-Compatible Tool Versions:**
  - Flutter SDK: Use the latest stable ARM64 build from flutter.dev
  - .NET 9 SDK: ARM64 installer available at dotnet.microsoft.com
  - Docker Desktop: ARM64 version available at docker.com
  - Git for Windows: Use the latest installer (ARM64-compatible)
  - Node.js: Download ARM64 installer from nodejs.org

### Flutter State Management Standard
- **Primary Tool:** Riverpod (or Bloc for complex app flows).
- **Rule:** All 36-60+ apps must use the same state management solution for
  consistency across the monorepo.
- **Avoid:** setState beyond simple local UI state; GetX; Provider (deprecated).

### Enterprise-Level Security & Caching Guidelines

#### Authentication & Authorization Security
- **JWT Token Management:** Use short-lived access tokens (15-60 min expiry)
  with refresh token rotation. Store tokens in Flutter Secure Storage - never
  in plain SharedPreferences or localStorage.
- **Brute Force Prevention:** Enforce a maximum of 5 login attempts, then
  trigger exponential backoff or a temporary account lockout (15-30 min).
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce Firebase MFA for all admin
  and high-privilege accounts.
- **Session Invalidation:** Implement server-side session revocation on logout
  or suspicious activity detection (e.g., unusual IP or device fingerprint change).

#### API & Network Security
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** All API endpoints must be served over HTTPS/TLS 1.2+.
  Reject plain HTTP requests at the Cloud Run ingress level.
- **CORS Configuration:** Define strict CORS policies — allow only known app
  origins. Never use a wildcard `*` in production environments.
- **Rate Limiting & Throttling:** Enforce per-IP rate limits on all API endpoints
  (e.g., 100 requests/min per user). Use Cloud Armor or ASP.NET Core middleware.
- **Request Size Limits:** Cap all incoming request body sizes to prevent memory
  exhaustion attacks (recommended maximum: 5 MB per request).
- **API Versioning:** Always version APIs using path-based versioning (e.g.,
  `/api/v1/`, `/api/v2/`) from day one to prevent breaking changes across live apps.

#### Data & Database Security
- **SQL Injection Prevention:** All database queries must use parameterized queries
  or prepared statements — never raw string concatenation.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement robust schemas (Zod, Joi, or
  express-validator) to validate and sanitize all user inputs before database
  insertion.
- **Row Level Security (RLS):** Enforce Supabase RLS policies on every database
  table — no exceptions, no bypass.
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Client-side code uses only the Supabase
  anon key. Server-side scripts use the service role key via secure environment
  variables — never hardcoded.
- **Data Encryption at Rest:** Ensure Supabase encrypted storage is enabled.
  Sensitive fields (e.g., payment tokens) must never be stored in plain text.

#### Backup & Disaster Recovery
- **Automated Backups:** Schedule daily automated Supabase database backups.
- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** System must be restored within 4 hours
  of a confirmed incident.
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO):** Maximum acceptable data loss is 24 hours.
- **Backup Testing:** Restore a backup to a staging environment at least once
  per quarter to verify integrity.

#### Anti-Hacking & Attack Prevention
- **XSS Prevention:** Sanitize all user-generated content before rendering.
  Never inject raw HTML. Use server-side output encoding.
- **CSRF Protection:** Use anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing API requests.
  Leverage `SameSite=Strict` cookie attributes on all session cookies.
- **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning:** Run `flutter pub audit` and
  `dotnet list package --vulnerable` as mandatory CI/CD pipeline steps.
- **Secret Management:** Never commit credentials, API keys, or passwords to
  version control. Use `.env` files (listed in `.gitignore`) and GitHub Actions
  Secrets for all CI/CD pipelines.
- **Audit Logging:** Log all authentication events, admin actions, and API errors
  to Google Cloud Logging for full traceability and forensic readiness.
- **Anomaly Detection & Alerting:** Monitor for unusual traffic spikes, repeated
  failed auth attempts, and abnormal data access patterns using Google Cloud
  Monitoring alerts.
- **Sensitive File Protection:** Actively maintain `.gitignore` to safeguard all
  local credentials and `.env` files from accidental public exposure.

#### Caching Strategy
- **Database Query Caching:** Use Redis or Memcached for read-heavy operations.
  Cache frequently accessed data: user profiles, subscription status, app configs.
- **Cache Invalidation (TTL Rules):**
  - Subscription status: TTL 5 minutes
  - App configuration / static data: TTL 1 hour
  - User profile data: TTL 15 minutes
- **CDN Caching:** Enable Cloud CDN or Cloudflare for static assets once the
  user base exceeds 50,000 (aligned with the Scaling Rule in Section 6).
- **Flutter-Side Caching:** Use `flutter_cache_manager` or `Hive` for local
  offline caching of API responses. Avoid redundant network calls to reduce
  latency and backend load.
- **API Response Caching:** Cache non-personalized API responses using standard
  HTTP cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`) at the Cloud Run middleware level.

#### Error Logging & Monitoring
- **Primary Tool:** Google Cloud Logging + Google Cloud Monitoring (built into GCP).
- **Optional:** Sentry for client-side Flutter crash reporting and error tracking.
- **Rule:** Every unhandled exception in production must be logged with sufficient
  context to reproduce and fix the issue within one development cycle.

### CI/CD Standard
- **Primary Tool:** GitHub Actions (Never use Jenkins).
- **Reasoning:** Jenkins demands higher maintenance, adds complexity, and is less
  suitable for solo development.
- **Pipeline Workflow:**
  ```
  Build -> flutter pub audit -> dotnet list --vulnerable -> Test -> Docker Build -> Artifact Registry -> Cloud Run Deploy
  ```
- **Testing Requirements:**
  - Flutter unit & widget tests: `flutter test` (minimum 70% code coverage).
  - Backend unit tests: `xUnit` or `NUnit` (minimum 70% code coverage).
  - Integration tests must pass before any Cloud Run deployment is triggered.

### Testing Standards
- **Flutter Testing Framework:** `flutter_test` (built-in).
- **Backend Testing Framework:** `xUnit` or `NUnit` for ASP.NET Core.
- **Minimum Coverage Target:** 70% line coverage across all packages and the backend.
- **Test Types Required:**
  - Unit tests for all shared package logic.
  - Widget tests for all shared UI components.
  - Integration tests for all API endpoints.
- **Rule:** Tests must run on every pull request via GitHub Actions. A failing test
  blocks the merge.

### OCR Standard
- **Preferred Tool:** Google ML Kit (On-device OCR).
- **Reasoning:** Offers on-device processing, low latency, zero API costs, and better
  scaling.
- **Rule:** Avoid Cloud OCR for every request.

### Authentication Standard
- **Primary Service:** Firebase Authentication.
- **Methods:** Email, Google, Apple.
- **Rule:** Avoid building custom authentication systems.

### Database Standard
- **Primary Service:** Supabase PostgreSQL.
- **Stored Data:** Users, History, Subscription Data, Settings, Analytics.

### Ads Standard
- **Primary Service:** AdMob.
- **Free Plan:** Ads Enabled.
- **Premium Plan:** Ads Removed.

### Payments Standard
- **Primary Service:** Stripe.
- **Subscription Support:** Monthly and Annual Subscriptions.
